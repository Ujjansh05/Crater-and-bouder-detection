![GitHub repo top image](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Mars_crater.max-1000x1000.png)

This project provides an automated system to detect and classify craters and boulders on planetary surfaces from high-resolution **OHRC (Orbiter High-Resolution Camera)** images. It leverages deep learning techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to perform accurate feature extraction and analysis.

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal is to create a robust model that can automatically identify geological features like craters and boulders from satellite imagery. This automation is crucial for:
* **Improving surface exploration** and geological mapping.
* Assisting in **resource identification** on other planets.
* Supporting space missions by providing valuable data for **landing site selection** and safe terrain navigation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automated Detection:** Uses AI/ML to eliminate the need for manual, time-consuming analysis.
* **High Accuracy:** Employs modern object detection and classification techniques for reliable results.
* **Scalable:** Capable of processing large volumes of high-resolution satellite images efficiently.
* **Data-Driven:** Trained on labeled datasets of craters and boulders to ensure model robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The detection process is built upon a standard deep learning pipeline for object detection:

1.  **Data Collection:** Utilizes high-resolution planetary images, such as those from an OHRC.
2.  **Image Preprocessing:** Images are normalized, resized, and cleaned to prepare them for the model.
3.  **Data Augmentation:** To improve model generalization and prevent overfitting, various augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments) are applied to the training dataset.
4.  **Model Training:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the preprocessed and augmented dataset. The model learns to distinguish the unique features of craters and boulders.
5.  **Inference & Detection:** The trained model is used to predict bounding boxes and classify craters and boulders in new, unseen images.
